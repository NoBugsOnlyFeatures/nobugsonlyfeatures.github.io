My name is Soren Ludwig. I am also known as NoBugsOnlyFeatures, or OnlyFeatures.

I'm a software engineer by day, and a lot more by night. I have a lot of hobbies, friends, and family that enrich my life.

The purpose of this blog is to talk about myself, and the things I'm interested in talking about.
