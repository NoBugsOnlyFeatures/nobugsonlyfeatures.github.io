# Redefining Masculism

## Intro

I know, I know. I'm sure this topic has been written into the ground and back again. Nothing of novelity is likely to be contained within the lines below, but I'm bored and feeling rightious. I want to write about what I think the positive Masculism movement should be. There's nobody that can stop me, if you have suggestions, submit a pull request.

## Are we the baddies?

Kinda yeah, we are the baddies. As a group that represents the concept of the male gender, we have a lot of issues. We have obsessions about power and anything that might seem like a threat to that power. I think it has to do with some idea of survivalism that polutes the concept of male existence. We got to be the top dogs, otherwise society and the collective human project will fail. We got to be the "strong man" or as my concerningly alcoholic neighbor told me once a "macho man". For context, he was talking about Jesus, of which I wouldn't consider a "macho man".

What really resonated with me was a moment in a session of Blades of the Dark where two male characters came to a head about dominance. I wanted to create a character that would be hated by the two other player charcters, so that he could eventually be set up to be sent to jail (for mechanical purposes). Instead I made someone they hated so much they decided to murder him immediately. My hyper masculin man with an alpha male belief structure told the other toxic male in the group that he was a bitch and he now knew his place. Irreconciable violence insued. The other PC shot lightning at my character, and my character engaged in bodily melee to knockout or kill them. Neither backed down, which ultimately lead to the death of my character. I was ok with this, since I designed him to be a toxicly masculin and a horrible person. My group is comfortable and safe enough with each other that we were able to play that out. 

The whole thing really got me thinking a lot about what does it mean to be a good man?
Sufficed to say, I have ideas.

## What is power, trust, and discipline?

I think masculinity is about three primary virtues: power, trust, and discipline. I won't be concerning myself on how these can be bad. There's plenty of written material out there about how the modern masculin ideology on these subjects can be or is harmful. With some simple internet searches can yeild mindful content on these thought exercises. I want to theorize on how these are virtues, rather than forms of abuse to the self or community. I also want to note that virtues or desierable traits aren't strictly gendered. Women or non-binary people can embody the values of power, trust, and disicpline. All I'm trying to say is that we associate certain virtues with different gender projects to provide some foundational pillars to aspire to. 

The human experience is broad and deep. There's more than 8 billion of us fuckers on this dirt ball, so humanity is bigger than any one of us can imagine.

Enough prefacing, lets get to it.

### Power

The ability to control our environment or other living beings. More common ideas of power include wealth, social influence, political leverage, or martial ability. Personal skill and intelligence are other forms of power. Both represent psudo-independant strength. Never the less, the idea of power no matter it's form is tied to masculinity. It makes sense, we got to get shit done. Not only for ourselves, but  importantly for others. Humans are dependant on each other. It's virtually impossible to live in complete isolation. Even if you live naked in the wilderness, you still are probably vaccinated (a uniquely human endevor) and have an education of some kind (other people sharing knowledge with you that you use). We are forever part of a tapestry that we call humanity. Pure individualism is impossible.

Men like to (and probaby should) value our power. Through it we are able to accomplish good works, by which help ourselves and others. There is glory in good works. Not is it a defiance of the errosion of time and the burning energy of entropy, but it's also a positive mark we are able to make in this world. It's important to leave our good mark in the world.

Power does not imply leadership. It's important to exert your talent, skill, or ability especially when you aren't a leader. You do need to do your best in the role you are in. There are exceptions when you shouldn't, but when you are part of a good project that you are intent of being in, doing good works is important for the whole to function. People do depend on you. Failure is bound to happen, and that's ok. That's part of any labor. We should try to resist it though rather than to allow it to control us.

### Trust

The ablity to believe in other people, and other to believe in us. I feel inside of the majority of the masculin mindset is that there are people out to get us. In reality, that isn't true. There are people out there who would, if given the oppertunity, would harm others for some reason. But they aren't in the majority by a long shot. Most people don't care about percieved differencens that would lead to conflict and want to be left well enough alone.

Maybe I'm unique in my privilege, but I've reached a state of stabilty I don't really want for things. There is oppertunity to exploit others for my gain but... why? My material needs are met. I desire love, but only as a product of time, effort, affection, and connection. So there is no need for me to break trust, even if that trust at a minimum is that I will leave one well enough alone. Perhaps I don't care about creating trust with someone who's ideals or practices violate the "greater good" or would harm others without REALLY GOOD REASONS.

### Disicpline

The ability to repeatedly fulfill promises, to either yourself or others. This is tied to work, but is less about the potency or ability to, but the repeatable expression of power.

## All of the above is kind of bullshit

Tying virtues or positive attributes to a certain gender is pointless. It's my belief gender is expression of style and a social construct based on the existance of biological sex. Virtues are tied to the soul (or conciousness). A person is powerful, loyal, or disicplined dependant on their choices, labor, and results of the former two.
