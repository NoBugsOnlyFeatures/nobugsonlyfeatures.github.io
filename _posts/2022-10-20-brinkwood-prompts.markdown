## 2022/10/20 Brinkwood Prompts

## To My Mysterious Marauders,

Your friend and lover from afar; here to write to you once again.

I must say, how you dealt with wth the Master of Ceremonies' spreadsheets and efficient Accountants was unexpected. Putting aristocratic legitimacy to your "violin" making business wasn't the way I expected you to go. Sure, it didn't stop the thugs that paid the woodcarver a visit to remind him of his place; but at least now there won't be any future thugs coming to impart harsh physical reminders. At least so long as you can produce a musical instrument that meets the standard of that dumb bitch, Isabel Grismont.

I digress.

I have a business proposition for you. As I mentioned in a previous missive, I like money and probably not for the reasons you think. I also happen to have an impressive supply of weed in my inventory, and the use of a warehouse for a weekend in Stamleigh. If you want to sell drugs, make a bit of coin, and spread the gospel of your movement, please reply at your earliest convenience.

Love,
Silver

## To Young Warrior Encarmine

After our last talk, I have determined you are ready for The Great Hunt. Aside from the Countess herself, there is a vampire in this land of great martial skill: The Masked Hunter. He is a beast that personifies the art and craft of taking another's life. He answers to the beck and call of The Countess with unquestioning devotion.

If your conviction of a free land and a free people is written true to your soul, then your quest will inevitably lead to the Masked Hunter. Though facing such a force of murder is beyond us, for now. To grow to that challenge we must look to prey that is much more manageable.

It is this time of year that Bill the Bull, a major lord of Innisfirth, will be setting into the Brinkwood to cull the beasts of the forest. This is to keep his adjoining farmlands free of things that eat his precious cattle. This is when we will strike him.

An ambush in the Brinkwood on the lord and his party is the peak of advantages. If we cannot dispose of a foolish vampire wandering the lands that belongs to us and the wild of the woods, then we have no right to challenge the Masked Hunter.

Brink your weapons, wits, and water (and a snack), and we will put down this monster.

Yours,

Yamato
