# General Updates

Long time since I touched this thing. A lot has happened since 2022. The plague is now an endemic. I lost my job at my shitty high tech job, gained a better job in the public sector. I gave up chasing after a career in game development because it was too hard. I'm in a regular D&D and Blades in the Dark groups.

I'm working on too many things, and as a byproduct, getting very little done of personal projects.

My sleep is miserable, because I don't want to go to bed until 1am. Especially on work nights.

Definitely existing in a gray haze these days. I wish I felt joy more often. But I think a lot of people feel that way.

Anyways, signing off. Take care.
