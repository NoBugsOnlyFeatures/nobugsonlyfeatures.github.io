## Setting The Stage

I like to buy manga. I like the style, the art, the length and size of the books, and the stories that are told within. American comic books never resonated with me in the same way manga has. Super heroes never fully resonated with me, and never found the diversity of stories I was looking for in American comicbook literature.

After reaching a level of personal financial stability, buying manga (which is around $10 to $12 each), became my choice retail therapy. Especially during the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was like recieving little gifts in the mail.

Even after the pandemic starts to move towards an endemic, I love my little books I get in the mail which contained a packet of art and story that sustained my soul.

The latest of my treats to myself are two manga: Last Gender vol 1, and Reincarnated As A Girl vol 1,2,3. I had a feeling going in that I might have a weird time with the former, and personal indulgence in garbage with the latter. I was only half right.

Spoilers ahead.

## Story of Last Gender

In the first volume of Last Gender, there are five vingettes involving patrons bar called called a BAR California. The bar is a place where identity and personal status don't matter, and you're able to engage in "intimate play" (i.e. sex) with consenting individuals. Though it isn't only a place for sex, some patrons come to the bar simply to be as be the gender or sexuality that they feel is natural to them.

The first story is set to establish the setting and explain the breadth and depth of gender and sexuality. Minami, a woman who's been cheated on by her husband, comes to the bar to try to understand where he's been sneaking off to. There she meets a trans woman, Ran, who seduces her into having sex. In their exchange the viewer learns that Minami has always felt boxed in by the expectations of society, and Ran is jealous of those who are accepted by society for who they are and who they love. Minami leaves the bar feeling liberated, both of her empty marriage but also by the expectations pushed upon her. It seems Ran is left without a happy end, but in the next chapter, she get's her due.

Ran's story details the hardship of not only being Bisexual, but transitioning to female. Her inner mologue covers the social issues of transitiongng such as the expectations of tohers, but also the medical and legal challenges of getting gender afferming care.  During her internal frustrations, a cis pansexual man Mao, is genuinly pursing Ran for who she is. She consistently brushes Mao away, thinking he's another person trying to impose their own ideas on her. In a moment of clarity for Ran, Mao is able to confess that he wants to know her as who she is. It's then it clicks in Ran's mind that this man might be the love she was looking for. Ran wants to jump his bones as a way of getting to know each other, but Mao adoarbly says he is too shy when other people are watching (in BAR California).

The next chapter we get Mao's history and a lead in to Marie (a gender fluid person). Mao's family life is rough, his parents believe there is something wrong with him for being pansexual. He effectively disowns them, and they continiously try to take him to conversion therapy. Marie tells him that keeping somethings to yourself from your family is ok. Mao resolves to make his past self proud, even if his parents don't accept him.

This leads to Marie, someone who identifies mostly as male, but partly as female. They present themselves as a man outside of BAR California and heavily female within with cute dresses, wigs, and make-up. However, they hide their female identiy from their family, fearing the wife and daughter they love will come to hate them should they reveal their bigender nature. It's when Amiru, an aromantic woman that frequents the bar for sex, finds out Marie's double life. She comments how wonderful for it is for Marie to have this love in their life, that to not their lying ruin what they have. After getting new insight into what Marie has, they rush home and share their secret to their wife. Though their wife is shocked, they want to learn.

Amiru's story is mostly a monologue on living a life where she doesn't understand love and is shunned for not understanding. People accuse her of being a slut or broken in some way. After sex with a mysterious blindfolded man, he drops some advice to her. He says she should be the protagonist of her own life. From that she realizes that her life may not be a romantic story, but it is her story and the rest are the cast.

This mysterious man, Yukihiro is set up to be the protagonist of the next chapter, but that is where the volume ends.

## Story of Reincarnated As A Girl

Everything goes right for Ren.

Ren was a scientist of our world (of some unknown disipline), reborn in a world of fantasy and magic. He (or her, they don't really their gender in any meaninful way) awakens in the wreakage of a caravan admist a storm. She (I'll use she/her pronouns for them going forward because that's how they portray themselves in the world) uses "scientific knowledge" (ie basic survival training and grade school science) to build a shelter and start a fire using magic to dry wood and leaves and then fire to ignite it. It's there she falls asleep until the next day.

She has a dream of being an overly enthusiastic sex slave to a wealthy man. Upon waking up she recalled in this world's life, she was travelling to meet that man? This is where the story is unclear in the details, though it's heavily implied that she was to become a concubine for this man in exchange for the continued existence of the orphanage. Upon Ren having this revelation bails on her meeting with the wealthy man and the orphanage.

It's at this point I can only assume the conciousness of the scientist is in complete control, and the person who was Ren is gone. The reason for this due to the minimal, if not nonexistant, emotional ties or sense of obligation to the other children at the orphanage.

Later Ren is wandering futher into the wilderness with no particular destination and runs into the obvious problems of thirst and hunger. She tries to eat some weeds, but gets sick from eating random plants on the ground. Haphazardly, she wishes for water and it magically appears to her. So surprised by this turn of events, she attempts to wish for a riceball in the same way. Sure enough, a perfectly salted riceball appears in her hands and solves her hunger problems.

She can literally wish any non-living material into existence, killing any stakes there were in trying to survive in a wilderness. Just because she's special.

There is the constraint that manifesting objects from nothing takes a lot of MP (yes, she does have HP, MP, stats, and a status screen she can summon), but she can effectively create anything so long as she has some understanding of how its made.

From this point on, she spends time creating a net for fishing, a grill for cooking, stamina boosting potions for enough energy to make a house (I am unsure how she knows what a potion is and what goes into it; or how, in that world's physics, stamina correlates to MP). She summons a McMansion of a house into existence using raw materials, then takes a sensious bath.

The next conflict to arise is that she wants to eat meat. Which is weird considering she already had access to meat by fishing. I have no explaination, but this prompts an arc where she figures out how to throw a rock really fast with magic to hunt animals. She kills some weird rabbits. Then she enters in a life or death battle with a boar, ending with her shearing off the upper half of the animal's skull (which was awesome).
